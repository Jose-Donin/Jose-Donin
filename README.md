## About Me!
Hi, my name is Luis, I'm a computer engineer.
I really enjoy programming, for me it's kinda like magic, the closest to it.
My favorite language is by far C, I think it's intuitive and fun to program in it, especially due to its powerful simplicity. However, I also program in Python, JavaScript, some C++ (for college homework and stuff) and Java, although, I'd say Java is also another one that I learned mostly for curiosity and college projects.
I love working with GUI projects, both in C and Python, and have started to implement them in most of my projects, but I'm also an avid script writer on Linux, which has been my OS since 2013, usually going between Pop_OS and other distros, but mainly Pop_OS for Nvidia related issues.
I'm also married to an amazing wife with whom I share the most wonderful moments of my days, and also three beautiful dogs for good measure!
